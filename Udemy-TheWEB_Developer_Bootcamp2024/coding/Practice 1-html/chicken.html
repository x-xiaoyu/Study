    <p> The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl,
        originally from Southeast Asia. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of
        junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock
        are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel.
        A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually
        immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food
        (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting,
        which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are
        layers.

    <p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals,
        with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.
        There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
        There are numerous cultural references to chickens—in myth, folklore, and religion,
        as well as in language and literature.

        由于这段文字以“Lorem ipsum”起头，并且常被用于标题的测试中，所以一般称为Lorem ipsum，简称为Lipsum。 网站没有建设完时，也会出现这样的段落，甚至有些是故意的，包括使用 网页制作 软件， 网页模板
        等，新建时一般都会出现Lorem ipsum段落。
