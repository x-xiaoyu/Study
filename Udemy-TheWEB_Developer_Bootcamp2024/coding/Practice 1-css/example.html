    <h1>Currlefish</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Cuttlefish, or cuttles, are marine <b><a href="">molluscs</a> </b>of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class
        Cephalopoda which also
        includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which is
        used for control of buoyancy.

        Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with
        which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest
        species, the giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama), reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in
        mass.[2]
    <p>
        Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators
        include dolphins, larger fish (including sharks), seals, seabirds, humans, and other cuttlefish. The typical
        life expectancy of a cuttlefish is about 1â€“2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most
        intelligent invertebrates.[3] Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all
        invertebrates.[3]

        The Greco-Roman world valued the cuttlefish as a source of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from
        its siphon when it is alarmed. The word for it in both Greek and Latin, sepia, now refers to the reddish-brown
        color sepia in English.

    <h2>Range and Habitat</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabit tropical/temperate ocean waters. They are mostly
        found in shallow coastal waters, but they can be found anywhere from the intertidal zone to depths of 600 m
        (2,000 ft). They prefer sandy/muddy bottoms, where they can bury themselves with their eight arms and wait for a
        passing fish or crab. They are sometimes called the chameleons of the sea because of their ability to rapidly

    <h2>Anatomy and Pphysiology</h2>
    <h3>Visual System</h3>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The organogenesis and the final structure of the
        eye fundamentally differ from those of vertebrates such as humans. Superficial similarities between cephalopod
        and vertebrate eyes are thought to be examples of convergent evolution.[4] The cuttlefish pupil is a smoothly
        curving W-shape. Although cuttlefish cannot see color, they can perceive the polarization of light, which allows
        them to detect the angle of the sun and navigate accordingly.[5] Their cuttlebone is made of aragonite.[6]

    <h3> cuttlebone </h3>
    <p>Cuttlefish possess an internal structure called the cuttlebone, which is porous and is made of aragonite. The
        pores provide it with buoyancy, which the cuttlefish regulates by changing the gas-to-liquid ratio in the
        chambered cuttlebone via the ventral siphuncle. Each species' cuttlebone has a distinct shape, size, and pattern
        of ridges or texture. The cuttlebone is unique to cuttlefish, and is one of the features that distinguish them
        from their squid relatives. Cuttlebones of a wide variety of fossil cephalopod species have been found.
